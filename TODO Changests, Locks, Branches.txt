# TODO issue with Release/Remove Unlock menu available right after doing a checkout on an asset already locked elswehere
=> should be prevented as a case of "double lock" but isn't, perhaps do we need to remove the LockId from the cache state!



# Improved onboarding
1. Download link if missing Plastic SCM
2. Enter Credentials & Select the Cloud Organization if not already configured


# Add a caching system for Lock List
Right now it is called way too often, even multiple times in a second! (while it takes 150-200ms to execute in my current workspace)!
  1. when the user browse their content browser, folder by folder, each folder trigger a new call
  2. if they have the View Locks window it's even double that (x2)

# Performance issue in the current cache system
PlasticSourceControlUtils::UpdateCachedStates() report a change in the cache even when there is none, which triggers more useless work


# Revision Control Menu
 - Cleanup by moving all lower priority docs and settings into sub menus => focus on daily Actions on the first level menu

# View Locks window
 - Configure rules button
 - Link to documentation

# View Branches window
 - Open Branch Explorer button
 - Hierachical tree view

# Changesets History window

Add Tasks to the Epic:

 - with filters by date, but also by branches, searching capabilites etc
 - "preview" the content of each changeset (list of assets)
 - ability to sync back to any previous changeset (regardless of the branch)
